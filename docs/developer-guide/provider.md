# Creating a New Provider in Prowler

Below are instructions for creating new providers in Prowler with all the relevant checks in order to achieve a safer cloud.

## Introduction

Providers form the backbone of Prowler, enabling security assessments across various cloud environments.

A cloud provider is a third-party company that offers on-demand IT resources via its platform. Prowler currently supports the most widely used cloud providers, including:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- Microsoft Azure

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Adding a New Provider

To integrate a cloud provider not yet supported by Prowler and implement security checks, follow these steps: Create a dedicated folder to store all related files (services, checks, etc.).

This folder must be placed within `prowler/providers/<new_provider_name>/`.

Within this folder the following folders are also to be created:

- `lib` – Stores additional utility functions.
- `services` – Stores all [services](./services.md) to audit.
- `__init__.py` (empty) – Ensures Python recognizes this folder as a package.
- `<new_provider_name>_provider.py` – Defines authentication logic, configurations, and other provider-specific data.
- `models.py` – Contains necessary models for the new provider.
By adhering to this structure, Prowler can effectively support security checks for additional cloud providers.

## Provider Structure in Prowler

Prowler's provider architecture is designed to facilitate security audits through a generic service tailored to each provider. This is accomplished by passing the necessary parameters to the constructor, which initializes all required session values.

### Base Class

All Prowler providers inherit from the same [base class](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/common/provider.py). It is an [abstract base class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) that defines the interface for all provider classes.

#### Class Definition:

```python title="Provider Base Class"

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any

class Provider(ABC):
    """
    The Provider class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all provider classes in the auditing system.

    Attributes
        type (property): Specifies the type of provider.
        identity (property): Represents the provider's identity for auditing purposes.
        session (property): Manages the provider's session for audit operations.
        audit_config (property): Stores audit configuration details.
        output_options (property): Defines output settings for auditing.

    Methods
        print_credentials(): Displays the provider's credentials in the CLI.
        setup_session(): Sets up the session for the provider.
        validate_arguments(): Verifies input arguments for validity.
        get_checks_to_execute_by_audit_resources(): Retrieves a set of checks based on the input resources.

    Note:
        This is an abstract base class and **should not be instantiated directly**. Each provider must implement its own version of the `Provider`
        class by inheriting from this base class and defining the necessary methods and attributes.
    """

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def type(self) -> str:

### Provider Class

#### Provider Implementation Guidance

Given the complexity and variability of cloud providers, use existing provider implementations as templates when developing new integrations.

- [AWS](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/aws/aws_provider.py)
- [GCP](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/gcp/gcp_provider.py)
- [Azure](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/azure/azure_provider.py)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/kubernetes/kubernetes_provider.py)
- [Microsoft365](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/blob/master/prowler/providers/microsoft365/microsoft365_provider.py)

### Basic Provider Implementation: Pseudocode Example

To simplify understanding, the following pseudocode outlines the fundamental structure of a provider, including library imports necessary for authentication.

```python title="Provider Example Class"

# Library Imports for Authentication

# When implementing authentication for a provider, import the required libraries.

from prowler.lib.mutelist.mutelist import parse_mutelist_file
from prowler.lib.utils.utils import print_boxes
from prowler.providers.common.models import Audit_Metadata
from prowler.providers.common.provider import Provider
from prowler.providers.<new_provider_name>.models import (
    # All provider models needed.
    ProviderSessionModel,
    ProviderIdentityModel,
    ProviderOutputOptionsModel
)

class NewProvider(Provider):
    # All properties from the class, some of which are properties in the base class.
    _type: str = "<provider_name>"
    _session: <ProviderSessionModel>
    _identity: <ProviderIdentityModel>
    _audit_config: dict
    _output_options: ProviderOutputOptionsModel
    _mutelist: dict
    audit_metadata: Audit_Metadata

    def __init__(self, arguments):
        """
        Initializes the NewProvider instance.
        Args:
            arguments (dict): A dictionary containing configuration arguments.
        """
        logger.info("Setting <NewProviderName> provider ...")

# Initializing the Provider Session

# Steps:

# - Retrieve Cloud Account Information
# - Extract relevant account identifiers (subscriptions, projects, or other service references) from the provided arguments.

# Establish a Session

# Use the method enforced by the parent class to set up the session:
        self._session = self.setup_session(credentials_file)

# Define Provider Identity
# Assign the identity class, typically provided by the Python provider library:

        self._identity = <ProviderIdentityModel>()

# Configure the Provider
# Set the provider-specific configuration.

        self._audit_config = load_and_validate_config_file(
            self._type, arguments.config_file
        )

    # All the enforced properties by the parent class.
    @property
    def identity(self):
        return self._identity

    @property
    def session(self):
        return self._session

    def audit_config(self):
        return self._audit_config

    @property
    def output_options(self):
        return self._output_options

    def setup_session(self, <all_needed_for_auth>):
        """
        Sets up the Provider session.

        Args:
            <all_needed_for_auth> Can include all necessary arguments to set up the session

        Returns:
            Credentials necessary to communicate with the provider.
        """
        pass

    """

    information during the prowler execution as a header of execution.
